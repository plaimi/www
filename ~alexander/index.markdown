#Programming languages

Programming languages and their theory and applicability is my biggest 
interest. My current favourite is Haskell, and I keep a collection of
[recommended Haskell reading and watching](haskell.html).

As a curiosity, see the
[language overview](https://www.ohloh.net/accounts/alexanderb/languages) on
ohloh. It is a reasonable good account of how many lines of public code I 
have in different languages. This site has aggregated this from the 
repositories of currently publicly available code. Of course, I have written
code that is not publicly available (especially while learning a new
language), so take these figures with buckets of salt. They are however, quite
interesting to me. They paint a reasonable picture of what languages I am
using for "real world work".

Another curiosity would be the
[skills & knowledge](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hackerwizard) people have
endorsed me for on linkedin. I'm not sure I agree with all of them, but it's
interesting to see what people at least *think* I am good at.
