plaimi advocate privacy and freedom on the Internet. As such we will support 
[Reset the Net](https://www.resetthenet.org/). Reset the Net is a campaign to 
raise awareness and free Internet users so that they can take care of 
themselves, and keep the level of privacy they want to retain on the Internet.

Privacy is a technological and a sociological challenge. The former solves 
itself if we solve the latter by raising awareness. Help raise awareness. Help

P.S.
Please note that the video unfortunately conflates the term "hacker" with the
term "cracker". A cracker is someone who wants to "crack open" or break into a
system. A hacker is someone who enjoys playful cleverness and cares about
hacker ethic. Considering it is our hacker ethic that prompts us to take 
action, it makes us sad to hear someone use that word in a derogatory manner.
