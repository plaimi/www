title: Announcing the Trondheim Haskell Users' Group
---
Following Alexander's move to Trondheim, it's only natural for plaimi to take 
on the responsibility of proselytising Haskell to Tr√∏ndere. The vehicle for 
this is the [Trondheim Haskell Users' 
Group](http://www.meetup.com/Trondheim-Haskell-Users-Group/) (THUG).

THUG will be about... whatever the members want it to be about. But probably 
mostly Haskell. :)

If you are in the Trondheim area and interested in Haskell, make sure you
don't miss THUG's [first
meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Trondheim-Haskell-Users-Group/events/224896251/)!
