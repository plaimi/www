title: What we're up to + announcing blubber
---
Following our authoring a [paper that described an e-learning module authoring 
tool](/papers/2015-04-11-learn-by-teaching.html), we have now acquired funding 
for a pre-project in which you hope to substantiate our idea. This means 
evaluating the related research properly, and establishing a cohesive idea for 
the minimally viable product.

Unrelated entirely is [blubber](/games/blubber.html). blubber is a simple 
arcade game in which you control a blub, that needs to blubber all the smaller 
blubs, in other to grow big enough to blubber the rest of the blubs. Expect 
lots of neat updates!
