title: About plaimi
---

plaimi are a [free software](https://fsf.org) 
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell) game development
company based in Norway. 

plaimi spiritually launched when [Alexander](~alexander) and [Stian](~stian) 
met at [Høgskolen i Gjøvik](https://hig.no/) during Autumn, 2010. A more 
formal launch happened during Autumn, 2011. This included registering this 
domain, setting up infrastructure, and commencing work on our first game that 
was publicly released (and publicly developed). Since then we have worked on 
many different things.

plaimi became a registered joint-stock company under the Cerpus group in 
January 2014.

In 2015 we were joined by [Olle](~olle), who briefly worked as a full-time 
employee, and has stayed on as a non-employed member since.
